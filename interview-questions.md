# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: virtual dom in react are essentially a virtual copy of DOM

Researched answer: virtual dom is essentially an abstract and lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This allows react to speed up development and rerendering.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: implicit return means a 'return' does not need to be typed out on the code.

Researched answer: inplicit return tells me that the last piece of code will be what is being returned unless the code is written to do otherwise. This negates the need to write the keyword 'return'

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: some similarities are  things like they both have the concept of function, conditionals, and built in methods. some difference are in things like the writing syntax. In javascript we have camelCasing whereas in ruby we have snake_casing. 

Researched answer: well, they both fall under being high-level languages which makes it eaier for developers to write human-like code. Both are also object-oriented which means they focus around the concept of objects and classes. Some differences can be seen in their usage and syntax. Javascript is often used by developers to enhance interactitvity and funtionality to web pages and uses camelCasing. Ruby on the other hand, is known for its readability and productivity. Aside from web development, ruby is also used for scripting, automation and more. Also, ruby uses syntax like snakecasing.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

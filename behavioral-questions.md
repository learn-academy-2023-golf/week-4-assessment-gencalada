# ASSESSMENT 4: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Why did you choose a career in software development?

- Nugget: Ive dabbled a bit in technological concepts like networking and pc building. It wasnt until i got out of the military that I noticed how powerful having knowledge in technical skills like networking can be in the real world. Then with some research I stumbled across the vettec that offered two programs I was intersted in my area. both of which offered learning software development. Some more research insued and I grew very interested in pursuing a career in software development.

- Situation: I grasped some concepts in networking pretty well but when it came to learning any programming language, I tried out things like udemy, youtube, and other online tools to no avail.

- Task: I needed a more structured learning environment that I would be more dynamic and would also hold me accountable to keep me from straying off my learning. Its very easy to let trivial things in life to get in the way of your learning when there is nothing holding you accountable.

- Action: I decided to contact the VA and begin my process with the vettec. The program I decided was a best fit for me was LEARN Academy. 

- Result: I am currently still a student with LEARN and can honestly say I am enjoying every moment of being a part of LEARN.





2. In previous roles, how have you helped teammates succeed?

- Nugget: In my previous job, while I was a suporvisor, one of my main focuses aside from making sure every one of my officers having the same basic understanding of their duties and responsabilities, I would focus on being approachable to encourage everyone bringing up issues and questions they may have no matter how insignificant they may assume it may be.

- Situation: Before I became a suporvisor, I was blessed with being a regular guard. During which time I became very familiar with learning ceetain tasks on my own to avoid the possobility of appearing incompetent. This type of thinking caused unnedded added stress and proved to be inefficient when I needed to complete a task I was not completely familiar with. All because I decided to refuse to ask a question when I first was experiencing this issue.

- Task: When I accepted the offer to be a suporvisor, experiencing my learning the way I did, i decided to make a change on how a suporvisor would typically run their respective shifts.

- Action: As part of making a presence in each manned post I would stress the importance of asking questions to ensure our daily tasks are getting accomplished successfully and efficiently.

- Result: This created an environment where most officers would speak up and ask questions to whatever they may be having trouble with. everybody was familiar with each other.
